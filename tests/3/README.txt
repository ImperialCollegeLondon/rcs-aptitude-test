Hello,

Everytime I run this program it just says "Segmentation fault" and makes a file called "core". Google tells me that my program is making an invalid memory access, but I don't know where! Can you help me find the problem? I've another program that sometimes gives the same error, so knowing how to do it for myself in future would be helpful.

Jack
